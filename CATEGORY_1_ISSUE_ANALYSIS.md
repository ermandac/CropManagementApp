# Category 1 (Fruits) Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary
After running the bulk upload, **all Fruits crops (category 1)** have no data in the Guidelines dropdowns:
- Introduction - Empty
- Scientific Name - Empty  
- Duration - Empty
- Varieties - Empty
- Season - Empty
- Materials - Empty
- Weed Control - Empty
- Irrigation - Empty
- Harvesting - Empty

## What's Working
- **Category 5 (Plantation)** - Sugarcane shows all data correctly from Firestore
- The app **can load from Firestore** (proven by Plantation working)

## Root Cause
The `Adapter_CropOptions.java` loads data using `Class_DatabaseHelper` which reads from:
1. **Old SQLite database** (`cms.sqlite`) - This had the original working data
2. **OR** from Firestore through `getCropFieldById()` method

After bulk upload, something broke the connection between category 1 crops and their data source.

## Possible Causes

### Theory 1: Document ID Mismatch
- The bulk upload created crops with IDs 1, 2, 3 (Banana, Mango, Papaya)
- But the original Fruits crops had **different IDs** in Firestore
- When `Adapter_CropOptions` tries to load crop ID "2" (Mango), it might be looking for the wrong document

### Theory 2: CategoryId Issue
- The bulk-uploaded crops have `categoryId: 1` (number)
- But the app expects crops to be stored differently

### Theory 3: Data Structure Mismatch
- The old Fruits data might have been stored in a different Firestore format
- The bulk upload overwrote it with a new format that the app can't read

## Solution Options

### Option A: Delete ALL Crops Collection and Re-upload
1. Delete the entire `crops` collection from Firestore
2. Modify `firestore_migration.json` to ONLY include categories 2-6 (exclude category 1)
3. Re-run bulk upload
4. Your original category 1 data remains in the old system

### Option B: Check Original Firestore Structure
Need to see what category 1 crops looked like in Firestore BEFORE the bulk upload

### Option C: Manual Data Entry
Use the Admin Panel to manually add Fruits crops one by one

## Recommended Next Step
**Check your Firestore Console to see:**
1. Are there multiple documents with categoryId = 1?
2. What are the document IDs of your original working Fruits crops?
3. Are there duplicate crops with different IDs?

This will tell us exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.
